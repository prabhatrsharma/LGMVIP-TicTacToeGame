# Tic Tac Toe Game in Java (GUI)

## Introduction

This Java-based Tic Tac Toe game with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a fun and educational project developed as part of my internship. The game provides a simple, user-friendly way to play the classic Tic Tac Toe game against an AI opponent or with a friend. It serves as a great starting point for understanding Java Swing and game development.

- Player vs. Player modes.
- Responsive and intuitive GUI.
- Win detection and game-over states.
